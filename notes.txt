rc_local.sh appears to be *the* startup script.
Copied its contents to /etc/rc.local
Run it on startup with crontab
    It calls start.sh (and check-board.sh which is MIA)
        start.sh calls run-notifier.sh and run.sh
            run-notifier.sh calls led_notify.py
            run.sh calls sagan-control-daemon.py
                sagan-control-daemon.py calls server.py

I may need to install the python modules in requirements.txt
requests is installed.
websocket-client now installed
sagan is installed

Does config.json need to be cleared?

why is lxpanel consuming so many resources?
should i disable it? isn't this thing supposed to be running headless anyway?
is the access-point the only reason it takes so many resources? I think it is.
Commented out lightdm command in /etc/X11/default-display-manager to try working without it.
This screwed things up. need to fix xorg display size. 

is check-board.sh still necessary? I don't think it is.
it removes duplicates of files that are not duplicated in the current sagan python package
its if conditions return false on the current debian 10 sagan board.

rc-local.service starts /etc/rc.local automatically.
I don't think I need a crontab for it.

why does "sudo shutdown -r now" sometimes get stuck with "dhcpcd.service" displaying on screen?
