rc_local.sh appears to be *the* startup script.
    It calls start.sh (and check-board.sh which is MIA)
        start.sh calls run-notifier.sh and run.sh
            run-notifier.sh calls led_notify.py
            run.sh calls sagan-control-daemon.py
                sagan-control-daemon.py calls server.py

I may need to install the python modules in requirements.txt

Does config.json need to be cleared?
